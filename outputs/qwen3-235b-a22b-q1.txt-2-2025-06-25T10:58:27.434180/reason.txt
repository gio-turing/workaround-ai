Okay, I need to write a Hello World function in Java. Let's start by recalling the basic structure of a Java program. Java is an object-oriented language, so typically, you have a class with a main method. The main method is the entry point for applications.

Wait, the user said "function," but in Java, functions are part of classes. So probably, they want a method that prints "Hello, World!" either from the main method or another method. But the standard Hello World in Java uses the main method. Let me think: maybe they want a function that can be called, which outputs the message.

So, the class should have a public static void main method. Inside that, we can use System.out.println to print the string. Alternatively, create a separate method, like a static method called sayHello(), and call it from main. But the simplest solution is just to have the main method with the print statement. Let me check examples.

Standard Hello World code:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Yes, that's the common way. So the function here is the main method itself. Alternatively, if the user wants a separate function, but maybe that's complicating. Since the user said "function," perhaps they just want the main method. But in Java, the main method is required. So the correct approach is to create a class with the main method that prints the message.

I should make sure that the code is correct. The class name should match the file name, but the user didn't specify a particular name, so using "HelloWorld" as the class name is standard. The System.out.println statement uses the correct string. Also, check for syntax errors: the main method signature is correct, with String[] args. Also, the code is properly enclosed in braces.

I think that's all. So the code should be as follows.
