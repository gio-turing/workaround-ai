Okay, I need to write a Hello World function in Java. Let's start by recalling the basics of Java syntax. The user wants a function, so maybe they mean a method that prints "Hello, World!". 

First, Java programs start with a class. The main method is the entry point. But since the user asked for a function, perhaps they just want a method that outputs Hello World. But the example might need to be a complete program, so I should create a class with a main method that calls this function.

Wait, maybe the user just wants the function itself. But in Java, you can't have a function outside a class. So the solution should be a class with a method. Let's structure it properly.

The standard way is to create a public class, say HelloWorld, with a main method. Inside the main method, we can call another method, like sayHello(), which prints the message. Alternatively, the user might want the function to be static so it can be called from main without an instance.

Yes, so the steps are:

1. Define a public class named HelloWorld.
2. Inside the class, create a main method.
3. Create a static method, perhaps called sayHello, which uses System.out.println to print "Hello, World!".
4. In the main method, call sayHello().

Wait, but maybe the user just wants the function, not the entire program. However, in Java, the code must be part of a class. So the minimal solution would be a class with a main method that prints the message. Alternatively, a separate method.

Alternatively, the user might accept a static method that prints the message. Let me write the code.

The standard Hello World in Java is:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

But the user asked for a "function". So perhaps they want a method that does this. So maybe:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void helloWorldFunction() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        helloWorldFunction();
    }
}

But maybe they just want the function, not the main method. However, the code needs to be compilable. So including the main method is necessary for a complete example.

Alternatively, the user might consider the function as part of a class, even if it's not the main method. So the function would be a method in a class. Let me proceed with creating a class that has a method to print Hello World, and have the main method call it.

Yes, that's the approach. So the code would be:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sayHello();
    }
}

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the function to return the string instead of printing it. But the term "Hello World function" typically refers to printing it. So I'll stick with printing.

I should make sure that the code is correct. The method is static, so it can be called from main. The main method is present, which is required for execution. The class name matches the filename if saved as HelloWorld.java. 

Yes, this should work. So the code defines a class with a static method that prints the message, and the main method calls that function. That should be the solution.
